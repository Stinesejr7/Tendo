<h1 class="overskrft">WHAT IS TENDO?</h1>
<h3 class="brodtekst">Tendo is a soft robotic exoskeleton, imagine a robotic glove, which strengthens your grip.
It covers the thumb, index finger and forearm and itâ€™s equipped with soft artificial tendons and smart sensors detecting when you
are about to grasp an object and applies the requested strength to your fingers.

Tendo creates greater independence for people suffering from limitations due to e.g. arthritis, an injury, stroke or age.
Tendo results in an improved self-image and quality of life as well as a reduced need of assistance from the community and family.
Tendo is worn almost like a glove and enables a strong grip in more or less all everyday situations.</h3>
